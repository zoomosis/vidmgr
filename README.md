INTRODUCTION

This archive provides a set of screen drawing, cursor and
keyboard routines for text mode MS-DOS, OS/2 and Windows NT
applications.


EVOLUTION

VidMgr began life in March 1996 and provided support for a
limited set of DOS and OS/2 compilers.  Now, two months later,
the first "official" version has been released and provides
support for a number of additional compilers, as well as support
for 32-bit MS-DOS programs compiled with EMX.  A Windows NT
module has also been added.
